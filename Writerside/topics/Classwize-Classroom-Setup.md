# Classwize Classroom Setup

The College uses Family Zone/Linewize web filtering to monitor and filter our internet traffic.

For students, YouTube is blocked by default, as are other media intensive websites/services to prevent
our bandwidth being stretched to the limit. There are some industrious students who manage to find
workarounds from time to time, such as hot-spotting to their phone. At other times a specific word
on a page may prompt a block that you’ll need to open up.
If a website is blocked by the school (not by the DET – as some are), you can provide timed student
access, through the Classwize interface, but you’ll need to have Classes set up.

5. Create a name for your class – This is global across the school and each name can only be
   used once. Please name your class with the Year Level, Subject and Teacher Code to make
   them unique to you. (eg Year 8 Maths – BAJ)
6. Leave the Switch for the “Invitation Code” off. You are able to manually add students to your
   class, which is recommended, just like in Google Classroom. Using the invitation code means
   students need to log into the Classwize system to join a class
7. Select “Save”.

end of a semester, otherwise they will continue to apply to students running in their new
classes.
