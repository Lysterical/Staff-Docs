# Creating Bypass Codes and Rules

Classwize allows teachers to create class-specific filtering rules that either block or allow access to websites when their classes are in session.

This means that while your school has created filtering policies within School Manager, teachers can still override policies in Classwize to help manage their classes and to support their students’ learning needs. For example, they can temporarily unblock access to sites like gaming or social networking to reward students for good behavior or completing tasks, or block access to an unfiltered site to encourage students to focus in class.

> There are other tools which should come into use with some future
updates, such as being able to pause the internet for all or individual
students or open a reward site for students who finish early.

1. Start your class by clicking on the class name, not the settings cog.

2. Click on Start Class and select the time for the class to end. Please keep this in-line with the
   end of your session so altered filtering doesn't affect other classes.

3. Once the class is running you can generate a Bypass code. Please only use these for very
   specific circumstances where you can’t give access through setting Rules for the class.

>Students using a Bypass Code should be supervised to make sure they aren’t accessing
content like Snapchat or Facebook.

Here you can set a rule for an entire class, such as opening YouTube, or blocking it!

select from, or you can paste a specific
URL (web address) in the “This rule
controls” field.

>Elect to apply the rule to the whole
class or a list of individuals.
